# TODO

## Bugs

- [ ] Sunlight/skylight not being smoothly lerped correectly
- [ ] Fix apperance of lead (likely fixed by adding `gbuffers_basic`)
- [X] Entity tint not applied correctly eg. when hurting entities
- [X] Fix incorrect drawing of shadows

## Improvements

**Shadows**
- [ ] Night is too bright
- [ ] Quality of shadows is constant rather than dependent on depth
- [ ] Apperance of rain can be customised
- [X] Provide toggle option for shadows as it can cause lags
